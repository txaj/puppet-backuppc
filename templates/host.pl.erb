#
# In the steady state, each time a full backup completes successfully

#
# If filling of incremental dumps is off the oldest backup always
# has to be a full (ie: filled) dump.  This might mean one or two
# extra full dumps are kept until the oldest incremental backups expire.
#
# Exponential backup expiry is also supported.  This allows you to specify:
#
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 1 * $Conf{FullPeriod}, followed by
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 2 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 8 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 16 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
#
# and so on.  This works by deleting every other full as each expiry
# boundary is crossed.
#
# Exponential expiry is specified using an array for $Conf{FullKeepCnt}:
#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 2, 3];
#
# Entry #n specifies how many fulls to keep at an interval of
# 2^n * $Conf{FullPeriod} (ie: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...).
#
# The example above specifies keeping 4 of the most recent full backups
# (1 week interval) two full backups at 2 week intervals, and 3 full
# backups at 4 week intervals, eg:
#
#    full 0 19 weeks old   \
#    full 1 15 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 2 11 weeks old   / 
#    full 3  7 weeks old   \____  2 backups at 2 * $Conf{FullPeriod}

#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# On a given week the spacing might be less than shown as each backup
# ages through each expiry period.  For example, one week later, a
# new full is completed and the oldest is deleted, giving:
#
#    full 0 16 weeks old   \
#    full 1 12 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 2  8 weeks old   / 
#    full 3  6 weeks old   \____  2 backups at 2 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 4  4 weeks old   /
#    full 5  3 weeks old   \
#    full 6  2 weeks old    \___  4 backups at 1 * $Conf{FullPeriod}
#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# You can specify 0 as a count (except in the first entry), and the
# array can be as long as you wish.  For example:
#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2];
#
# This will keep 10 full dumps, 4 most recent at 1 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
# followed by 4 at an interval of 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod} (approx 1 month
# apart), and then 2 at an interval of 32 * $Conf{FullPeriod} (approx
# 7-8 months apart).
#
# Example: these two settings are equivalent and both keep just
# the four most recent full dumps:
#
#    $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = 4;
#    $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4];

# Level of each incremental.  "Level" follows the terminology

#
# The entries of $Conf{IncrLevels} apply in order to each
# incremental after each full backup.  It wraps around until
# the next full backup.  For example, these two settings
# have the same effect:
#
#       $Conf{IncrLevels} = [1, 2, 3];
#       $Conf{IncrLevels} = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];
#
# This means the 1st and 4th incrementals (level 1) go all
# the way back to the full.  The 2nd and 3rd (and 5th and
# 6th) backups just go back to the immediate preceeding
# incremental.
#
# Specifying a sequence of multi-level incrementals will
# usually mean more than $Conf{IncrKeepCnt} incrementals will
# need to be kept, since lower level incrementals are needed
# to merge a complete view of a backup.  For example, with
#
#       $Conf{FullPeriod}  = 7;
#       $Conf{IncrPeriod}  = 1;
#       $Conf{IncrKeepCnt} = 6;
#       $Conf{IncrLevels}  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
#
# there will be up to 11 incrementals in this case: 
#
#       backup #0  (full, level 0, oldest)
#       backup #1  (incr, level 1)
#       backup #2  (incr, level 2)
#       backup #3  (incr, level 3)
#       backup #4  (incr, level 4)
#       backup #5  (incr, level 5)
#       backup #6  (incr, level 6)
#       backup #7  (full, level 0)
#       backup #8  (incr, level 1)
#       backup #9  (incr, level 2)
#       backup #10 (incr, level 3)
#       backup #11 (incr, level 4)
#       backup #12 (incr, level 5, newest)
#
# Backup #1 (the oldest level 1 incremental) can't be deleted
# since backups 2..6 depend on it.  Those 6 incrementals can't
# all be deleted since that would only leave 5 (#8..12).
# When the next incremental happens (level 6), the complete
# set of 6 older incrementals (#1..6) will be deleted, since
# that maintains the required number ($Conf{IncrKeepCnt})
# of incrementals.  This situation is reduced if you set
# shorter chains of multi-level incrementals, eg:
#
#       $Conf{IncrLevels}  = [1, 2, 3];
#
# would only have up to 2 extra incremenals before all 3
# are deleted.
#
# BackupPC as usual merges the full and the sequence
# of incrementals together so each incremental can be
# browsed and restored as though it is a complete backup.
# If you specify a long chain of incrementals then more
# backups need to be merged when browsing, restoring,
# or getting the starting point for rsync backups.
# In the example above (levels 1..6), browing backup
# #6 requires 7 different backups (#0..6) to be merged.
#
# Because of this merging and the additional incrementals
# that need to be kept, it is recommended that some
# level 1 incrementals be included in $Conf{IncrLevels}.

# In v1.4.0 and later the default is off.
#
# BackupPC, and the cgi interface in particular, do the right thing on

# incremental backup with the most recent filled backup, giving the
# un-filled incremental backups a filled appearance.  That means it

#
# Filling backups takes a little extra disk space, and it does cost

#
# The exact behavior is determined by the underlying transport program,
# smbclient or tar.  For smbclient the exlclude file list is passed into
# the X option.  Simple shell wild-cards using "*" or "?" are allowed.
#
# For tar, if the exclude file contains a "/" it is assumed to be anchored
# at the start of the string.  Since all the tar paths start with "./",
# BackupPC prepends a "." if the exclude file starts with a "/".  Note
# that GNU tar version >= 1.13.7 is required for the exclude option to
# work correctly.  For linux or unix machines you should add
# "/proc" to $Conf{BackupFilesExclude} unless you have specified
# --one-file-system in $Conf{TarClientCmd} or --one-file-system in
# $Conf{RsyncArgs}.  Also, for tar, do not use a trailing "/" in
# the directory name: a trailing "/" causes the name to not match
# and the directory will not be excluded.
#
# Users report that for smbclient you should specify a directory
# followed by "/*", eg: "/proc/*", instead of just "/proc".
#
# FTP servers are traversed recursively so excluding directories will
# also exclude its contents.  You can use the wildcard characters "*"
# and "?" to define files for inclusion and exclusion.  Both

# to "blackout" and not backed up during hours and days specified by

#
# To allow for periodic rebooting of a PC or other brief periods when a
# PC is not on the network, a number of consecutive bad pings is allowed
# before the good ping count is reset. This parameter is

#
# Note that bad and good pings don't occur with the same interval. If a
# machine is always on the network, it will only be pinged roughly once
# every $Conf{IncrPeriod} (eg: once per day). So a setting for

# machine to be subject to blackout. On the other hand, if a ping is
# failed, it will be retried roughly every time BackupPC wakes up, eg,
# every one or two hours. So a setting for $Conf{BlackoutBadPingLimit} of
# 3 means that the PC will lose its blackout status after 3-6 hours of
# unavailability.
#
# To disable the blackout feature set $Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt} to a negative

# The fact this parameter is called 'TarShareName' is for historical

# In some cases you might need to change the broadcast address, for
# example if nmblookup uses 192.168.255.255 by default and you find

# address) using the -B option:
#
#    $Conf{NmbLookupFindHostCmd} = '$nmbLookupPath -B 192.168.1.255 $host';

# with the IP address of your WINS server):
#
#    $Conf{NmbLookupFindHostCmd} = '$nmbLookupPath -R -U 1.2.3.4 $host';

# Compression level to use on files.  0 means no compression.  Compression
# levels can be from 1 (least cpu time, slightly worse compression) to

# is 3.  Changing to 5, for example, will take maybe 20% more cpu time
# and will get another 2-3% additional compression. See the zlib
# documentation for more information about compression levels.
#
# Changing compression on or off after backups have already been done
# will require both compressed and uncompressed pool files to be stored.
# This will increase the pool storage requirements, at least until all
# the old backups expire and are deleted.
#
# It is ok to change the compression value (from one non-zero value to
# another non-zero value) after dumps are already done.  Since BackupPC
# matches pool files by comparing the uncompressed versions, it will still
# correctly match new incoming files against existing pool files.  The
# new compression level will take effect only for new files that are
# newly compressed and added to the pool.
#
# If compression was off and you are enabling compression for the first
# time you can use the BackupPC_compressPool utility to compress the
# pool.  This avoids having the pool grow to accommodate both compressed
# and uncompressed backups.  See the documentation for more information.
