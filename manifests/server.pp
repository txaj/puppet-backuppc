# == Class: backuppc::server
#
# This module manages backuppc
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
# Present or absent
#
# [*service_enable*]
# Boolean. Will enable service at boot
# and ensure a running service.
#
# [*wakup_schedule*]
# Times at which we wake up, check all the PCs,
# and schedule necessary backups. Times are measured
# in hours since midnight. Can be fractional if
# necessary (eg: 4.25 means 4:15am).
#
# [*max_backups*]
# Maximum number of simultaneous backups to run. If
# there are no user backup requests then this is the
# maximum number of simultaneous backups.
#
# [*max_user_backups*]
# Additional number of simultaneous backups that users
# can run. As many as $Conf{MaxBackups} + $Conf{MaxUserBackups}
# requests can run at the same time.
#
# [*max_pending_cmds*]
# Maximum number of pending link commands. New backups will only
# be started if there are no more than $Conf{MaxPendingCmds} plus
# $Conf{MaxBackups} number of pending link commands, plus running
# jobs. This limit is to make sure BackupPC doesn't fall too far
# behind in running BackupPC_link commands.
#
# [*max_backup_pc_nightly_jobs*]
# How many BackupPC_nightly processes to run in parallel. Each night,
# at the first wakeup listed in $Conf{WakeupSchedule}, BackupPC_nightly
# is run. Its job is to remove unneeded files in the pool, ie: files that
# only have one link. To avoid race conditions, BackupPC_nightly and BackupPC_link
# cannot run at the same time. Starting in v3.0.0, BackupPC_nightly can run
# concurrently with backups (BackupPC_dump).
#
# [*backup_pc_nightly_period*]
# How many days (runs) it takes BackupPC_nightly to traverse the entire pool.
# Normally this is 1, which means every night it runs, it does traverse the entire
# pool removing unused pool files.
#
# [*max_old_log_files*]
# Maximum number of log files we keep around in log directory. These files are aged
# nightly. A setting of 14 means the log directory will contain about 2 weeks of old
# log files, in particular at most the files LOG, LOG.0, LOG.1, ... LOG.13 (except today's
# LOG, these files will have a .z extension if compression is on).
#
# [*df_max_usage_pct*]
# Maximum threshold for disk utilization on the __TOPDIR__ filesystem. If the output
# from $Conf{DfPath} reports a percentage larger than this number then no new regularly
# scheduled backups will be run. However, user requested backups (which are usually
# incremental and tend to be small) are still performed, independent of disk usage. Also,
# currently running backups will not be terminated when the disk usage exceeds this number.
#
# [*trash_clean_sleep_sec*]
# How long BackupPC_trashClean sleeps in seconds between each check of the trash directory.
#
# [*dhcp_address_ranges*]
# List of DHCP address ranges we search looking for PCs to backup. This is an array of
# hashes for each class C address range. This is only needed if hosts in the conf/hosts
# file have the dhcp flag set.
#
# [*full_period*]
# Minimum period in days between full backups. A full dump will only be done if at least
# this much time has elapsed since the last full dump, and at least $Conf{IncrPeriod}
# days has elapsed since the last successful dump.
#
# [*full_keep_cnt*]
# Number of full backups to keep.
#
# [*full_age_max*]
# Very old full backups are removed after $Conf{FullAgeMax} days. However, we keep
# at least $Conf{FullKeepCntMin} full backups no matter how old they are.
#
# [*incr_period*]
# Minimum period in days between incremental backups (a user requested incremental
# backup will be done anytime on demand).
#
# [*incr_keep_cnt*]
# Number of incremental backups to keep.
#
# [*incr_age_max*]
# Very old incremental backups are removed after $Conf{IncrAgeMax} days. However,
# we keep at least $Conf{IncrKeepCntMin} incremental backups no matter how old
# they are.
#
# [*incr_levels*]
# A full backup has level 0. A new incremental of level N will backup all files
# that have changed since the most recent backup of a lower level.
#
# [*partial_age_max*]
# A failed full backup is saved as a partial backup. The rsync XferMethod can
# take advantage of the partial full when the next backup is run. This parameter
# sets the age of the partial full in days: if the partial backup is older than
# this number of days, then rsync will ignore (not use) the partial full when the
# next backup is run. If you set this to a negative value then no partials will be
# saved. If you set this to 0, partials will be saved, but will not be used by the
# next backup.
#
# [*incr_fill*]
# Boolean. Whether incremental backups are filled. "Filling" means that the most recent fulli
# (or filled) dump is merged into the new incremental dump using hardlinks. This
# makes an incremental dump look like a full dump.
#
# [*restore_info_keep_cnt*]
# Number of restore logs to keep. BackupPC remembers information about each restore
# request. This number per client will be kept around before the oldest ones are pruned.
#
# [*archive_info_keep_cnt*]
# Number of archive logs to keep. BackupPC remembers information about each archive request.
# This number per archive client will be kept around before the oldest ones are pruned.
#
# [*blackout_good_cnt*]
# PCs that are always or often on the network can be backed up after hours, to reduce PC,
# network and server load during working hours. For each PC a count of consecutive good
# pings is maintained. Once a PC has at least $Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt} consecutive good pings
# it is subject to "blackout" and not backed up during hours and days specified by $Conf{BlackoutPeriods}.
#
# [*blackout_zero_files_is_fatal*]
# Boolean. A backup of a share that has zero files is considered fatal. This is used to catch miscellaneous Xfer
# errors that result in no files being backed up. If you have shares that might be
# empty (and therefore an empty backup is valid) you should set this to false.
#
# [*email_notify_min_days*]
# Minimum period between consecutive emails to a single user. This tries to keep annoying email to users to
# a reasonable level.
#
# [*email_from_user_name*]
# Name to use as the "from" name for email.
#
# [*email_admin_user_name*]
# Destination address to an administrative user who will receive a nightly email with warnings and errors.
#
# [*email_notify_old_backup_days*]
# How old the most recent backup has to be before notifying user. When there have been no backups in this
# number of days the user is sent an email.
#
# [*email_headers*]
# Additional email headers.
#
# [*apache_configuration*]
# Boolean. Whether to install the apache configuration file that creates an alias for the /backuppc url.
# Disable this if you intend to install backuppc as a virtual host yourself.
#
# [*apache_allow_from*]
# A space seperated list of hostnames, ip addresses and networks that are permitted to
# access the backuppc interface.
#
# [*apache_require_ssl*]
# This directive forbids access unless HTTP over SSL (i.e. HTTPS) is used. Relies on mod_ssl.
#
# [*backuppc_password*]
# Password for the backuppc user used to access the web interface.
